This web application is designed to mimmick the catching of Pokemon. You can create new Pokedexes to hold different Pokemon however you would like.
Feel free to add and remove them from different dexes. You can select different Poke Balls just like in actual games. Higher rated balls give a
higher chance of catching the Pokemon.
